#MTG-Mana-Calculator

This ReactJS app is just a project to help my friends calculate their mana ratios faster for drafted decks!

To modify this app, do the following:

1. Fork this repo and clone
2. Navigate to the directory for the project and `npm install`
3. Once changes are ready to be deployed, `npm run predeploy` and then `npm run deploy` to create an optimized build, and then publish the changes onto the gh-pages branch, updating the Github Pages-hosted website
